pyAB is a Python package for Bayesian & Frequentist A/B Testing.



Features:
#########


**Bayesian A/B Test**:

- Conduct quick experiments to check for winning variant with additional prior information (Beta Distribution parameters).
- Try different evaluation metrics (Uplift Ratio, Difference & Percent Gain) & vary MCMC simulation sample size per variant.
- Visualize & inspect Uplift Density & Cumulative Density distributions.

**Frequentist A/B Test**:

- Conduct quick experiments to check for winning variant (Statistical significance).
- Estimate required sample size per variant to reach expected Type-II error rate.
- Visualize & inspect power curve for varying alternative proportions.
